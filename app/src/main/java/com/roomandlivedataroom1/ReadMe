1)Go to the project level turn on the top project folder right click and create a new resource directory and inside the resource directory create a graphics directory in which you would have to place your PNG icon

2)go to the app level then drawable right click and create an image asset inside the image I said you would have to select the path folder of the graphic icon PNG that you had placed

3)look for legacy and adaptive solutions artistic background as well as foreground wife of the icon and then test it across various API such as five and eight




1)Include material design dependency

2)add a floating action button not the extended one even though there are various versions of implementing the floating action button using the coordinator layout but this can also be implemented as a part of constraint layout some of the implementations require that setting vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary=true in App level gradle file default configurations well it is not the case for us now

3)provide a vector asset the desired form and add it as a part of its source and add a background tint

4)don't forget to have the constraints

Including butter knife
1)include it's compile options in the Android subtag off the app level gradle file
2)then in the dependencies section include the annotation processor and implementation I specified in the ggithub page
